The sound quality is good, though not amazing...it's good enough for when you're jogging around town or on the treadmill, in the gym, etc. If I wanted good sound quality, I wouldn't get earbuds, and certainly, anytime you are sweating into the speakers, the sound quality degrades. So it is what it is.

I also like how, if your ears get tired from having something in them, because of the hooks and the half-in-ear design, you can just take them out of the ear but leave them on, and turn up the volume a bit...so it's like having a speaker near your ear, rather than rubbing up inside it.

When I played Black Ops 3 my card was getting really hot up to 92c, that did not make me comfortable at all. So I was looking for VGA coolers to cool down my card, I did not want to do a water cooler because I love the blue LED windforce logo on my card, one of the reason why I went with gigabyte, it matches my blue theme but anyways this fits the bill nicely. It lights up blue lights so thats a plus, and you can adjust the fan speed but I just leave mine at medium settings because high is really loud. The lowest is not that quite its still louder than my other fans in my case but I have fan controllers for those too that make them dead silent. This my R9 390 go from 92c down to 72c which is just fantastic, but I also zip tied 120mm fan on the hard drive cage to blow air onto the card directly but this works though. I put it into a PCI-e slot near to my R9 390, so it indeed does helps you cool your card. Now my graphics card fans do not run loud at all anymore, and the temps are great.

5.0,316,True,"03 26, 2012",B007FGYZFI,"{'Configuration:': ' Base', 'Style:': ' 24-105mm'}","Some quick observations on the 5D3.  Before I go further I should explain I'll be comparing vs. the 5D2 and second, if you need to know about video, I can't be of any help there.

Received camera body from Amazon on 3/23.  Lots of new features (5D2 manual is 259 pages; 5D3 manual is 403 pages).  For the work I do, I was looking for two improvements over the 5D2:  Ability to bracket more than 3 shots and much lower noise.  The first wish was granted.  As you probably know, the 5D3 does 7 exposures.  Nikons do 9, but 7 is almost always enough.  Those who need more will probably have a Promote remote anyway.  Noise?  Well, the 5D3 images are cleaner but I wouldn't say dramatically so.  With the default noise settings and long exp NR set on, I'd say it's 1 to 1.5 stops better than the 5D2.  Now, with a little Noiseware or other NR, you can get very clean images at 12800 with very little loss of detail so I don't consider this a problem.  I guess it was unrealistic to expect the 5D3 to match the very low noise of my D700 but it would have been nice.

It's true that nearly every feature on the 5D3 is an upgrade over the 5D2.  Not all of these will result in better images but it's fair to say that the entire ""feel"" of the 5D3, the layout, viewfinder, displays are all nicer than the 5D2.  The two things that may be game changers, IMO, are the shutter and the AF.  If you haven't heard and felt the shutter on the 5D3, you're in for a treat.  It isn't just quieter; there is much less kick from the mirror.  Add the ""silent"" mode and, wow.  I would not be surprised to see signs in the future that say ""Please set your camera to silent mode"".  As for AF, I never had a problem with the AF on the 5D2 so I'm less impressed here.  But if you shoot moving subjects, the 5D3 has it all--predictive, wrap around, sequential, selective.  The manual devotes 45 pages to setting autofocus.

A small thing that I've been waiting for, a dual axis electronic level is wonderful.  For some time, digital SLRs have had an ""artificial horizon"" that tells you if you are tilting the camera to the left or right.  That's nice but in almost all imaging software, rotating an image takes just a second.  What these left/right levelers don't tell you is if you are tipping the camera up or down which can be a real pain with a super wide lens.  Well, problem solved with the 5D3.

The in-camera HDR is a mixed bag.  Output is jpeg only and even at that, it takes awhile for the 5D3 to register the images.  (This could be my cards which are Lexar UDMA 400x & Sandisk Extreme IV).  Anyhow, it's a fun feature.  This brings me to yet another interesting feature.  Since the 5D3 has two cards (CF + SD) you can record different file types to each card.  In other words, you could have a RAW-only card and a JPEG-only card.  I haven't tried this but I presume this would mean that you could shoot everything RAW except in-camera HDRs which, being jpegs, would end up on the other card.  I get requests for jpegs so now I can put them on one card while keeping an all-RAW card for myself.  You can also have redundant cards for backup, sequential for extra capacity, etc.  As with the autofocus options, the possibilities are endless!

So, to summarize.  Pros: Better AF, 100% viewfinder with electronic grid (no more screens), better LCD, faster drive and processor, fabulous shutter/mirror, 7-stop bracketing, 2-axis level, somewhat lower noise and thus somewhat cleaner images vs. 5D2, two card slots, uses same batteries as 5D2.  Cons:  Still no built-in flash (yes, it's very handy), in-camera HDR so-so, mode knob still feels flimsy (and it locks now, so be careful). All in all, this is a very nice, refined camera and anybody trading up from a 5D2 will be happy.  And if you do get a 5D3, the person getting your 5D2 will be happy as well.

Just a footnote.  One thing that comes through loud and clear from these reviews is how very different people's needs are and how differently they use a camera.  I can only explain how a product meets or fails to meet my needs.  I would not dream of saying you do/don't need this feature or ""read and decide"" as if I was some sort of oracle.

4.0,,True,"04 5, 2013",B002QGDWLK,,"I purchased this drive two months ago. I use it primarily to create DVD-R video DVDs using Taiyo-Yuden (JVC) TY02 DVD-R media. I test my burns with another Liteon drive using the ""DVD Speed"" software. The burns are generally good, although not quite as good as my old Plextor drive (ah, the days when you could actually purchase a premium drive that had superior specifications).

My one problem is something that perhaps most people won't care about: this burner will not burn at 1x. Why does this matter? Well, I still have a large number of older DVD+RW discs that I use almost every day for making test burns of new videos before I burn multiple copies onto DVD-R media. Some of these discs can only be burned at 1x. Unfortunately this burner does not have a 1x option and so it burns this media at a faster speed. The problem is that this faster write strategy makes the discs unreadable and, with this burner, they cannot be recovered. Fortunately, I have an older burner that can do a full erase, at 1x, and bring the media back to life. For the time being, I have to use this older burner, located on a seldom-used PC, to do the burns on this older media.

For most people, this deficiency is not a deal breaker, and I have found a way around it, as long as my older burner continues to operate, but I thought I should mention it in case you have any older 1x and 2x media lying around: you may not be able to burn reliably with this burner. For 4x, 8x, and 16x DVDs, this burner works just fine.","Good drive, but can't write to legacy media",1365120000,,JohnMeyer@hotmail.com

Good:
-The router is flexible and has great admin controls.  This really is an ethusiasts router--don't buy this if all you are interested is plug and play.
-Better range throughout my house, which is about 3000sqft on one level.  The 4th Gen Airport Extreme it replaces didn't have the same range
-External Antennae.  I don't know if this makes a difference, but I feel like it does.  You can adjust them, replace them, extend them if you want.
-Fast  . .I don't have empirical data but everything feels faster than my old router

Bad:
- Do you really need this router?  What bout its sibling, the cheaper N-only version?  I don't have a single AC client.  So why did I buy this one?  Sickness, I guess.
- Customer Support.  I called three times.  Was on hold for 30 minutes the first time, got disconnected.  Second time, got some voice mail after about 45 minutes.  Third time, I got through after 30 minutes to someone who was initially very obviously irritated to be taking my call, or anyone's call.
- Design . . the Netgear 6300 really has a beautiful design.  It stands up, with ports along the BOTTOM of the back of the device.  They advise you to stand up the ASUS for cooling purposes, but then the wires come out of the TOP . . it's hideous if your router is visible.

=====================================================
Edit 6/22

I'm lowering to one star.  The 5gz signal drops are real.  And they affect a lot of people.  After about 12 hours the 5 GHz signal loses strength and speed.  A simple re-apply of the settings using the router software boosts the signal back up to full strength.  I've done this about 5 days in a row.

I'll edit this review again if it is ever fixed.  However, the last firmware available from Asus is months old--and it's ""Beta.""  I think they are working on their new router.  If this problem isn't resolved I won't buy their new router.  , I'll never buy another ASUS product, ever.  And I currently have an ASUS PC, Android tablet (Transformer Infinity), and now this router.

I may yet return this and get the Netgear 6300 instead.  I've had good luck with Netgear in the past.  This router is generally rated higher than the Netgear, but router is not something I want to reboot daily.

Edit 6/22 part 2
To be fair, I was checking my driver software on my client card (an Intel Centrino 6250 series).  And the driver was out of date.  Why this wasn't updated by Windows Update?  Beats me.

I played with them in the house and could hear people talking. Cool! I wanted to try them in a vehicle without installing them permanently.

All of my old CBs seem to have power inputs that have 3 holes: 2 close together and 1a little further away. They work with this cord just fine. This cord has a white fuse holder with a 4 amp 250v fuse in it for protection.

The best way to get the quietest signal in a car is to apparently wire the CB directly to the battery... I'm a librarian, not a long-haired trucker so I wanted this cord to pop into my cigarette lighter for fun. I suppose later on I could cut the cigarette plug of and wire it more directly? I'm just playing around at the moment.

The cigarette lighter method induces the most amount of noise. I can hear my turn signal and engine rev up to about 25mph then it quiets down. Stepping on the breaks makes a loud noise just like someone clicking their mic but not saying anything. However this is with the squelch knob set to 0! With the squelch knob set to just 1 all of that disappears except sometimes hitting the brake will make the ca-chunk noise. I'm sure all would be fine setting squelch at 2. The worst noise funny enough was a LEAD light fixture in my garage, which caused me a little confusion into I shut it off, lol!

With the vehicle off there was no noise.

My test CB was an ancient Cobra 21gtl that I got free. The antenna was some no name brand freebie from the neighbor's recycling bin on a 9' cable. The vehicle was a 2000 Ford Ranger with 3.0L and automatic transmission and ZERO modifications of any sort: standard CD/cassette deck radio just like when I got it straight from the factory 17 years ago. Its got only 99,910 original miles on it...But it's still just an old farm truck basically. I have a feeling that newer cars would have less electrical noise/interference and better insulation since they're setup for wifi and Bluetooth, etc.

This cord is 6' long, the cigarette lighter plug fits snug. All good. I can plug/remove my CB in just a few seconds.

Recommendations: never mount your CB were you or your passenger legs are because you'll be horribly injured in even a minor fender bender! I just put my CB on the passenger seat since I'm not totally into this hobby yet.

Get a cigarette lighter expander for cheap. They have them with indiviual on/off buttons for each extra port. The ""MEIDI Car Accessories 3.1A 3-Socket Cigarette Car Lighter Power Adapter DC Outlet Splitter with 12V/24V Dual USB Car Charger for iPhone 6/6plus /7, Samsung Galaxy S6 and More"" is fairly awesome and shows your input voltage: 14v car running, 13.8v CB on, 12.8v car off, 12.7v car off CB on. It's less than 20 bucks and you can cut power to each of the three ports individually (car seat massagers and heater, CB, some third thing I'll pick up at a garage sale, right now it's a blinding spot light for no reason...Except I helped someone look for their glasses in a dark library parking lot with it, lol.).

This makes playing with CBs on your car easy: no messing with the actual wires in your car. You like CBs? Fine, go for amore permanent and quieter install. Until then squelch at 1 or 2 (the knob can go to 10!).

Another tip: NEVER click on your mic without an antenna plugged in because you can blow part of the radio. I just want to listen and not talk so I don't care BUT MY CBS DON'T WORK AT ALL UNLESS THE MICROPHONE IS PLUGGED IN! I have 4 CBs and only 1 mic which is slightly annoying: none work unless the mic is attached! Someone heard me talking about this and they're going to dig up about CB they don't want and give it to me... Hopefully they'll have some mics too.

Good luck or whatever we CB people say,

4.0,16,True,"12 4, 2013",B005JPWIAQ,{'Style:': ' FD'},"To get the lens to stop down (darken when you move f/stop ring) you must:

1. Mount the adapter onto the camera. 2. Slide the ring to OPEN. 3. Mount the lens. 4. Slide the ring to Lock.

Some FD lenses have a lock switch on the end that attaches to the camera: just slide the lever towards the lock and switch the tab to 'L' and then you can work the f/stop ring and the blades will close and open-permanent prewpview mode!

I successfully used this adapter on a Canon T2i camera to adapt and old Canon FD 50mm 1.8 S.C. lens and also used it with and without a Samigon CF1 Auto Teleplus 3x tele-extender.

It's been foggy for days, but I am able to focus on trees in the far-off distance, so I believe this will let you focus to infinity (which is why THIS adapter has a glass lens in it). Photos look sharp edge-to-edge, corners look fine, no vignetting.

Adapting a 'free' f/1.8 lens is very nice--lots of light and blurred background--but manually focusing with such shallow nice depth of field takes a little getting used to. At first I thought the lens was a little 'soft', or maybe the 40 year old UV filter was dirty, but maybe it was just a little lack of focus on my part.(update: all the FD adapters have a lens in them which creates haze, NOT in your viewfinder but in the final image at wide open fstops. f/1.8 is like a glamour photo on bright days, very hazy like fogged eyeglasses on a cold day. Stop down and it gets better. This seems to occur no matter what brand adapter used as far as I can tell from my reading online. Lighter objects almost glow with haze. I've adapted Olympus and Nikon lenses just fine but they are just metal adapters: no lens in them. My lens is useless at f1.8 but around f8 it's fine. On video it seemed okay too so I'm still happy, but I'm glad all my other lenses are adapted w/out glass adapters. Old Canon FD lenses just don't adapt as well as other makers-at least at extremely wide apertures. Your old Canon lens might be a telezoom that doesn't even open to 1.8, in which case you might be fine. My 3x tele extender also 3x the f/stop so with it the softness I was seeing was really at f6.4 wide open.)

Just in case you didn't know: your autofocus points will NOT light up and beep; you can use a Canon T2i on auto but your aperture will not register so you'll want to use it on Manual and adjust ISO and shutter speed on the camera after setting your f/stop on the lens manually. You will be focusing manually as well.

One other thing you might not be used to: old lenses have lots of jagged little levers and posts sticking out of them. Do not let them poke/scratch the center lens in this adapter. It's VERY easy to let this happen.

I already had a lens cap for my really old lens. The supplied front cap with this kit fit nicely as a body cap onto the old Canon FTb 35mm film SLR body which I snagged my lens off of-NICE! Now I don't have to buy a body/dust cap for the old film camera body. The rear lens end cap that came with this adapter says Canon on it and fits the adapter nicely.

I tried this on 1/7/17 with a Vivitar 28-210mm 1:3.5-5.6 macro focusing zoom lens With c/fd mount. On my eos with this adapter I can NOT focus on the house across the street or to infinity. I can however use the push/pull ring to pull to focus on object in the same room as me up to almost touching the lens, then turn the focus ring on the lens to get nice focus. I took video with this setup of stuff on a coffee table and it was beautiful! The house across the street is just a blur. In the video I was able to adjust f stop blurring and unbluring the background behind object in the coffee table (follow the procedure above for mounting or else for fstop will be locked open). With this lens i get less glare/haze at either end of the fstop range so that was nice for photos. In video i had no glare problems with the vivitar.

Each old lens is different with these Canon to eos adapters.

I got this last old canon lens for $5 so it's nice to be able too use them as macro lens and sometimes beyond. HOWEVER: the worst lens to adapt to eos are old canon fd lenses. The old olympus zuiko lenses need no glass in their adapters and just pop on and work to infinity. Same with ancient Nikon lenses.

If you're planning on buying a bunch of old film lenses for your newer digital canon dslr get olympus and nikon adapters and lenses-those adapters let those lenses work perfectly. All canon to eos adapters do NOT allow old canon lenses to work perfectly, but they can still be fun. I have a 4000mm old olympus lens and can focus on bolts and screws on passing airplanes, canon fd lens adapters won't let me focus on the house across the street.

Moreover: canon fd mounts are physically hard to take on and off the original cameras and these adapters. The adapters for old olympus lenses are easy to use. The adapters for old nikon lenses tend to get stuck on the old lenses. I have 1 canon fd to canon eos adapter; I have 1 Olympus om zuiko to eos adapter.  I have a few nikon to eos adapters PERMANENTLY STUCK onto some old nikons. Every old nikon someone gives me gets its own adapter since the jam on, lol. It's all great fun.

Old nikon: video. Old canon: macro video. Old olympus: great super telephoto, macro, ultrawide, fisheyes, etc.

If you have a box of old canon fd lenses then go for this. If you have a resale shop with lots of lenses: buy nikon and olympus adapters and lenses. ALL CANON FD TO EOS ADAPTERS DON'T WORK PERFECTLY (unlike the nikon and Olympus adapters).

Nikon and olympus to eos = serious photography and video work can be done.

Canon fd to eos adapters = fun, occasionally decent macro, weird effects, better than tossing the lenses in the garbage.

5.0,10,True,"10 25, 2013",B005TJ5CEG,,"First: the highest magnification objective lens is oil immersion only. You must put a drop of oil on your slide cover and then lower the lens into the oil to focus on anything. You must NOT do that with the other three lenses.

This is what allows the 2000x mag: light goes through oil instead of unsteady air. It's a fantastic feature at this price. Don't worry though, you can be happy just using the other 3 lenses, which is what I plan on using mostly.

**If you didn't know what oil immersion objective meant-know is the time to research 'microscopy techniques' along with 'microscope slide preparation' and 'cell staining' techniques and 'dark field' vs 'light field'-- illumination'. Basically: this is a 'real' microscope, and you should learn how to operate it in the proper manner to use it at its fullest. With that said, except for the 4th lens they throw in (oil immersion) a little kid could easily figure out all the features. There is supposed to be a slip of paper with address to download a manual-but I didn't see it. There are tons of omax videos on you tube if you need help.

I chose the LED light because: they run cold so it won't kill live pond cells like a hot halogen would. They also last longer.

So, how is this scope? Well it's better than what I used in high school and Chem I in university. It's way better than my 4 cheapie Tasco-style garage sale scopes and my homemade macrobellow system.

Assembly was easy: loosen knob at top to remove top cover. Remove clear cap on underside of head unit. Place head unit on top of scope and re-tighten knob. Pop in the eyepieces: my 20x were **really** tight and hard to install, but it's 40 degrees here and the metal holes that they fit into may have contracted a bit. Just be patient and they'll go in. That's it!! Oh, and plug it in for light.

The objectives are parfocal, meaning when you switch between them you only have refocus using the fine-focus knobs a little. Great feature which makes using it even more of a pleasure. There is a dimmer switch for the LED, and also a diaphragm under the stage-which was half closed when shipped: slide it open for even more light. Again, if you don't know what these terms mean you should start researching 'how to use a microscope'.

Optics appear flat and focused edge-to-edge, which is the opposite of many telescope mirrors I deal with~but that's another story. Each eyepiece spins for diopter adjustment, and the eyepieces slide apart for interpuppillary adjustment. Focus with one eye closed using the focus knobs, then switch eyes and focus that eye buy turning that eyepiece itself. Now open both eyes: both will be focused but you'll have double vision: slide the eyepieces further and closer apart. At some point the double vision goes away and in a snap you get a very wide-field view: a single view. It a little like those 'magic eye' optical illusion posters: once you get it-you get it. But it might take a few minutes of fiddling.

Delivery: I just joined amazon prime as a guest and this was the first thing I bought. It arrived (to Detroit) in less than 48 hours. It came with all the accessories listed and a nice cover too. It comes with a green filter in case you get chromatic flaring: but that's why the scope doesn't cost **literally** 15x more (at a minimum).
