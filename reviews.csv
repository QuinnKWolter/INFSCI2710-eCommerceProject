a) much quicker than my TomTom in picking up satellite signals
b) voice directions including road names
c) general (but not perfect) accuracy
d) generally (not always) sufficient warning is given for a turn
d) ability to update maps for free within 60 days of purchase -- online, and after registering.

Here's what I like less:

a) maps are much less detailed than TomTom -- that is, while streets are shown, many names are not shown, making it a bit difficult to plot one's position. Some dinky little streets are given names; some large streets (including those with US route numbers) are not.
b) while you're navigating from point A to point B, the name of the street on which you are actually driving is not necessarily given (instead you get the name of the street onto which you are next scheduled to turn).
c) often no account is taken of changes in road names; you are told to drive 5 miles on Jones Street, even though within a mile it becomes Elm Street.
d) route plotting nowhere nearly as good as that on TomTom (and going to the Garmin site, even with your machine plugged in and recognized, is no help)
e) unlike TomTom, while Garvin tells you your ETA, it does not tell you number of miles left to drive.
f) And finally, while Jane, the English woman who guides you on TomTom, has the voice of someone you'd like to invite home on a cold day for a cup of tea and a friendly talk, Garvin's English female sounds like a nanny, ready to find fault and only barely concealing her irritation when you do something she doesn't expect.",map questions,1282089600,,NicholasClifford@gmail.com

a) much quicker than my TomTom in picking up satellite signals
b) voice directions including road names
c) general (but not perfect) accuracy
d) generally (not always) sufficient warning is given for a turn
d) ability to update maps for free within 60 days of purchase -- online, and after registering.

Here's what I like less:

a) maps are much less detailed than TomTom -- that is, while streets are shown, many names are not shown, making it a bit difficult to plot one's position. Some dinky little streets are given names; some large streets (including those with US route numbers) are not.
b) while you're navigating from point A to point B, the name of the street on which you are actually driving is not necessarily given (instead you get the name of the street onto which you are next scheduled to turn).
c) often no account is taken of changes in road names; you are told to drive 5 miles on Jones Street, even though within a mile it becomes Elm Street.
d) route plotting nowhere nearly as good as that on TomTom (and going to the Garmin site, even with your machine plugged in and recognized, is no help)
e) unlike TomTom, while Garvin tells you your ETA, it does not tell you number of miles left to drive.
f) And finally, while Jane, the English woman who guides you on TomTom, has the voice of someone you'd like to invite home on a cold day for a cup of tea and a friendly talk, Garvin's English female sounds like a nanny, ready to find fault and only barely concealing her irritation when you do something she doesn't expect.",map questions,1282089600,,NicholasClifford@gmail.com
